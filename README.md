## Inspiration
When we visit local cafes, we love collecting loyalty stamp cards so that we can redeem free gifts after we visit and buy enough items. We wanted to digitize this so that this idea is simpler for businesses and users. 

## What it does
Our app saves a digital stamp card for businesses the user frequents, and when the user receives stamps (by making enough valid purchases), they are rewarded by the business. This reward may come in the form of a discount or a free item. Business owners are able to input information about their small business, which will allow the business to be displayed on the discover page for users to find. 

## How we built it
We used node.js for the backend and css & html for the frontend. We created the logo and stamp images using canva and google slides. We also used a lot of bootstrap to build the website, as it allowed for the quick and easy construction of a user-friendly website. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had trouble retrieving user location so that we could show the businesses that are in the user's vicinity because we had trouble making sure the popup asking for location information showed up. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of tackling the back-end of this app: especially finding data about the user's current location. Before this project, we were not comfortable with using node.js to code a backend, but we learned a lot and were able to code a functioning app. 

## What we learned
Like we stated previously, we learned a lot about how we can utilize node.js in apps. This was also Emma's first hackathon, so she learned a lot about time management under pressure and about how frameworks, such as bootstrap, can be used in apps. 

## What's next for stampd
We would love to program a page to allow users to create accounts, and also create a filtering function on the discover page to filter by type of business, how close the business is, and how
